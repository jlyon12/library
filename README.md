# Book Library

This project is part of The Odin Project Javascript Section.<br/>

The project brief can be found <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library">here</a>.

## Description

This was created using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to learn how to use object constructors in JavaScript. A new book object is created using user inputted data from a form modal. Once a book object is created it can be deleted or marked as "read" via the book card that is generated. There are several statistics about the book collection which are updated each time a new book is added or an existing book is updated.
